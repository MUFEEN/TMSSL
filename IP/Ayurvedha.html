    <h1>What is Ayurvedha?</h1><hr>
    
    <P>Considered by many scholars to be the oldest healing science, Ayurveda is a holistic approach to health that is designed to help people live long, healthy, and well balanced lives. The term Ayurveda is taken from the Sanskrit words 'Ayu' meaning life or lifespan, and 'Veda' meaning knowledge. It has been practiced in Sri Lanka and India for at least 5,000 years and has recently become popular in Western cultures. The basic principle of Ayurveda is to prevent and treat illness by maintaining balance in the body, mind, and consciousness through proper drinking, diet, and lifestyle and herbal remedies.

        The main type of Ayurveda is traditional. This Ayurveda is based on translations from the classical texts. Ayurvedic practitioners prescribe herbs, believe that disease results from an imbalance in the Doshas (see below), and use many of the same remedies for treating illness. Ayurveda, however, stresses the role of supreme awareness in maintaining good health, and promotes meditation as a way to experience the pure consciousness of the universe. It also highlights the expression of positive emotions and the need to adjust your life to the natural rhythms of the body.
        
        Just as everyone has a unique fingerprint, according to Ayurveda, each person has a distinct pattern of energy - a specific combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics. It is also believed that there are three basic energy types called Doshas, present in every person.
        
        Everyone has Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, but usually one or two are dominant in a particular person. Many things can disturb the energy balance, such as stress, an unhealthy diet, the weather, and strained family relationships. The disturbance shows up as disease. Ayurvedic practitioners prescribe treatments to bring the Doshas back into balance.
        
        From a Western medical viewpoint, stress relief seems to be one of the ways Ayurveda works to help fight illness. For example, studies have found that meditation, a part of Ayurveda, lowers anxiety and that Ayurveda lowers blood pressure and cholesterol, slows the aging process, and speeds recovery from illness.
        
        Many herbs used in Ayurvedic medicine have antioxidant effects, which mean that they help to protect long term illnesses such, as heart disease and arthritis. Many Ayurvedic practitioners also recommend a vegetarian diet, which is believed to be better for your heart than diets containing red meat.</P>
